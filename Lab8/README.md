# Lab 8: Packet Sniffing and Spoofing Lab

The objective of this lab is twofold: to learn how to use the tools and to understand the technologies underlying these tools. For the second objective, students will write simple sniffer and spoofing programs and gain an in-depth understanding of the technical aspects of these programs.

## Environment Setup using Container

In this lab, we will use three machines connected to the same LAN. We can either use three VMs or three containers. The image below depicts the lab environment setup using containers. We will conduct all attacks from the attacker container, while using the other containers as the user machines.

![container_setup](/Lab8/container/1.png)

### Container Setup and Commands

To create our environment, we use `/Lab8/container/docker-compose.yml` and the commands:
```bash
docker-compose build  # Build the container image
docker-compose up     # Start the container
```
![container_setup](/Lab8/container/2.png)

All the containers will run in the background. To run commands on a container, we often need to get a shell on that container. We do this by using:
```bash
dockps      # Alias for: docker ps --format "{{.ID}} {{.Names}}"
docksh <id> # Alias for: docker exec -it <id> /bin/bash
```
In our case, we enter into `host B` shell:
![container_setup](/Lab8/container/3.png)

### About the Attacker Container

In this lab, we can use either the VM or the attacker container as the attacker machine. If you look at the Docker Compose file, you will see that the attacker container is configured differently from the other containers. Here are the differences:

- **Shared folder**: A shared folder between the VM and the container, created using Docker volumes, facilitates file sharing for attack execution.

- **Host mode**: Necessary for the attacker container to sniff packets effectively, as it allows the container to see all network traffic by putting it in the same network namespace as the host VM.
  The following entry is used on the attacker container:

  ```bash
  network_mode: host
  ```
  When a container is in host mode, it sees all the hostâ€™s network interfaces and even has the same IP addresses as the host. Basically, it is put in the same network namespace as the host VM.

### Getting the network interface name

When we use the provided Compose file to create containers for this lab, a new network is created to connect the VM and the containers. The IP prefix for this network is `10.9.0.0/24`, which is specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

The corresponding network interface name in our case is `br-a418d7bac199`.
```bash
[04/19/24]seed@VM:~/.../Labsetup$ ifconfig
br-a418d7bac199: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 10.9.0.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 10.9.0.255
```



## Exercise 1: Using Scapy to Sniff and Spoof Packets

**Scapy can be used not only as a tool but also as a building block to construct other sniffing and spoofing tools, i.e., we can integrate the Scapy functionalities into our own programs. In this set of tasks, we will use Scapy for each task.**

To use Scapy, we can write a Python program and then execute this program using Python with root privileges because such privileges are required for spoofing packets.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from scapy.all import *

a = IP()
a.show()
```
**In order to run all the files for this lab, we first need to change the permissions of the scripts.**

```bash
chmod a+x <file_name>
```

```bash
[04/24/24]seed@VM:~/.../ex1$ escapy.py 
###[ IP ]### 
  version   = 4
  ihl       = None
  tos       = 0x0
  len       = None
  id        = 1
  flags     = 
  frag      = 0
  ttl       = 64
  proto     = hopopt
  chksum    = None
  src       = 127.0.0.1
  dst       = 127.0.0.1
  \options   \
```
![scapy](/Lab8/exercise1/img/1.png)

We can also enter the interactive mode of Python and then run our program one line at a time at the Python prompt:
```bash
[04/24/24]seed@VM:~/.../ex1$ python3
>>> from scapy.all import *
>>> a = IP()
>>> a.show()
###[ IP ]### 
  version   = 4
  ihl       = None
  tos       = 0x0
  len       = None
  id        = 1
  ...
```
![scapy](/Lab8/exercise1/img/2.png)

### Task 1.1 Sniffing Packets

We will use Scapy as a building block to construct other tools. The objective of this task is to learn how to use Scapy to perform packet sniffing in Python programs. To achieve this, we use the `Lab8/exercise1/task1_1.py` file:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from scapy.all import *

def print_pkt(pkt):
    pkt.show()

pkt = sniff(iface='br-a418d7bac199', filter='icmp', prn=print_pkt)
```

#### Task 1.1A

The goal of this task is to utilize Scapy to construct packet sniffing tools. For each captured packet, the callback function `print_pkt()` is invoked, displaying packet details.

##### With root privileges

Running `Lab8/exercise1/task1_1.py` with root privileges allows us to capture ICMP packets effectively from `hostA` (`10.9.0.5`):
```bash
sudo ./task1_1.py
```

As we can see in the images below, we successfully captured a packet by performing a ping from `hostA` (`10.9.0.5`):
![scapy](/Lab8/exercise1/img/3.png)
![scapy](/Lab8/exercise1/img/5.png)

##### Without root privileges

Lacking root privileges, the script fails to capture packets, highlighting the necessity of appropriate permissions for packet operations.

![scapy](/Lab8/exercise1/img/4.png)


#### Task 1.1B
When we sniff packets, we are interested in only certain types of packets. We can specify this by setting filters in sniffing.

We work on the same file `Lab8/exercise1/task1_1B.py`, but we use the appropriate filter for each task:

- **To Capture Only the ICMP Packet:**

  We use:
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/env python3
  from scapy.all import *

  def print_pkt(pkt):
    pkt.show()

  pkt = sniff(iface='br-a418d7bac199', filter='icmp', prn=print_pkt)
  ```
  And a ping from `hostA` (`10.9.0.5`)
  ![scapy](/Lab8/exercise1/img/3.png)

- **Capture Any TCP Packet That Comes from a Particular IP and with a Destination Port Number 23:**

  We use:
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/env python3
  from scapy.all import *

  def print_pkt(pkt):
    pkt.show()

  filter_expr = 'tcp and host 10.9.0.5 and port 23'
  pkt = sniff(iface='br-a418d7bac199', filter=filter_expr, prn=print_pkt)
  ```
  To successfully capture a packet, we need to send it using port 23, which is the default port for Telnet. Therefore, on `hostB (10.9.0.6)`, we run the following command (right window):
    ```bash
  telnet 10.9.0.5
  ```
  This allows us to log into `hostA (10.9.0.5)` container via Telnet, so our code can receive some packets (left window).
  ![scapy](/Lab8/exercise1/img/6.png)

- **Capture Packets That Come From or Go to a Particular Subnet:**

  You can pick any subnet, such as `128.230.0.0/16`
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/env python3
  from scapy.all import *

  def print_pkt(pkt):
    pkt.show()

  pkt = sniff(iface='br-a418d7bac199', filter='net 128.230.0.0/16', prn=print_pkt)
  ```
  We successfully capture a packet by doing a ping from `hostB (10.9.0.6)` to a host in the defined subnet (`128.230.0.15`)
    ```bash
  ping 128.230.0.15
    ```
    ![scapy](/Lab8/exercise1/img/7.png)


### Task 1.2 Spoofing ICMP Packets

As a packet spoofing tool, Scapy enables us to set the fields of IP packets to arbitrary values. The objective of this task is to spoof IP packets with an arbitrary source IP address. We will spoof ICMP echo request packets and send them to another VM on the same network. We will use Wireshark to observe whether our request is accepted by the receiver. If accepted, an echo reply packet will be sent to the spoofed IP address.

The `Lab8/exercise1/task1_2.py` file provides an example of how to spoof ICMP packets.
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from scapy.all import *

a = IP()
a.dst = '1.2.3.4'
b = ICMP()
p = a/b

ls(a)
send(p)
```

We also need to set up Wireshark to receive the packet from the host `1.2.3.4` and by the interface `enp0s3` as follows: 
![scapy](/Lab8/exercise1/img/8.png)

Now, we run `Lab8/exercise1/task1_2.py` to send the packet and observe it on Wireshark.
![scapy](/Lab8/exercise1/img/9.png)

### Task 1.3 Traceroute

The objective of this task is to use Scapy to estimate the number of routers between your VM and a selected destination. The idea is straightforward: send a packet (any type) to the destination with its Time-To-Live (TTL) field initially set to 1. This packet will be dropped by the first router. As we increase the TTL, we will receive the IP addresses of all the routers through which our packet passes until it reaches its final destination. To achieve this, we use the `Lab8/exercise1/task1_3.py` file.
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from scapy.all import *

# Destination IP address
destination = '8.8.8.8'

# Maximum number of routers to try
max_hops = 30

# Iterate over TTL values from start_ttl to max_hops
for ttl in range(1, max_hops + 1):
    a = IP(dst=destination, ttl=ttl)
    b = ICMP()
    
    # Send the packet and wait for a reply
    reply = sr1(a/b, verbose=0, timeout=2)
    
    # Handle no reply
    if reply is None:
        print(f"{ttl}: No reply")
        continue
    
    # Print the source of the reply
    print(f"{ttl}: Source: {reply.src}")
    
    # If the reply is an echo-reply, break the loop as the destination was reached
    if reply.type == 0:
        print("Reached the destination.")
        break
```

### Task 1.4 Sniffing and-then Spoofing

In this task, we will combine the sniffing and spoofing techniques to implement the following sniff-andthen-spoof program. We need two machines on the same LAN: the `VM (10.9.0.1)` and the `hostB (10.9.0.6)`. From the `hostB`, we ping an IP X. This will generate an ICMP echo request packet. Your sniff-and-then-spoof program runs on the `VM`, which monitors the LAN through packet sniffing. Whenever it sees an ICMP echo request, regardless of what the target IP address is, your program should immediately send out an echo reply using the packet spoofing technique. Therefore, regardless of whether machine X is alive or not, the ping program will always receive a reply, indicating that X is alive. 
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
import os
from scapy.all import *


def spoof_pkt(pkt):
    # sniff and print out icmp echo request packet
    if ICMP in pkt and pkt[ICMP].type == 8:
        print("Original Packet.........")
        print("Source IP : ", pkt[IP].src)
        print("Destination IP :", pkt[IP].dst)

        # spoof an icmp echo reply packet
        # swap srcip and dstip
        ip = IP(src=pkt[IP].dst, dst=pkt[IP].src, ihl=pkt[IP].ihl)
        icmp = ICMP(type=0, id=pkt[ICMP].id, seq=pkt[ICMP].seq)
        data = pkt[Raw].load
        newpkt = ip/icmp/data

        print("Spoofed Packet.........")
        print("Source IP : ", newpkt[IP].src)
        print("Destination IP :", newpkt[IP].dst)

        send(newpkt, verbose=0)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: sudo {} host_ip\n".format(
            sys.argv[0]))
        exit(1)

    host_ip = sys.argv[1]
    filter = 'icmp and host '+ host_ip
    print("filter: {}\n".format(filter))

    pkt = sniff(filter=filter, prn=spoof_pkt)
```

To use `Lab8/exercise1/task1_4.py` file, we need to run it like:
```bash
./task1_4/py <Host IP>
```

The snecarios are:

- A non-existing host on the Internet
  ```bash
  ping 1.2.3.4
  ```
  If the IP address exists in the LAN, ARP will resolve it to a valid MAC address, and the data packets can reach their destination. This means that spoofed packets with a source IP of an existing local host will reach the target because the ARP protocol can successfully map the IP to a MAC address.

  We observe that a ping request is sent to IP address `1.2.3.4` which doesn't exist in the local network. The left terminal shows the `Lab8/exercise1/task1_4.py` script capturing this ICMP request and sending a spoofed ICMP reply, making it appear as though `1.2.3.4` is an active host. The right terminal confirms this by showing that ping receives responses, even though there is no such host in reality.

  ![scapy](/Lab8/exercise1/img/11.png)

- A non-existing host on the LAN
  ```bash
  ping  10.9.0.99
  ```
  If the IP address does not exist on the local network, ARP requests for this IP will not be answered, and the network stack will eventually give up, resulting in a **"Destination Host Unreachable"** error at the IP layer, despite any spoofed ICMP replies. This error occurs because the data link layer (Ethernet) cannot proceed without a MAC address, even if the network layer (IP) packets are being spoofed.

  Depicts an attempt to ping `10.9.0.99`, a non-existent local host. Again, the left terminal demonstrates the capture of this ICMP request by the `Lab8/exercise1/task1_4.py` script and the sending of a spoofed reply. The right terminal, however, shows **"Destination Host Unreachable"** messages, which indicate that, despite the spoofing attempt, the network layer (IP) is reporting that the subnet can't be reached. This is likely due to ARP not being able to resolve the non-existent IP to a valid MAC address in the local network.
  ![scapy](/Lab8/exercise1/img/12.png)

  - An existing host on the Internet
  ```bash
  ping  8.8.8.8
  ```
  The `Lab8/exercise1/task1_4.py` script on the left captures  requests and sends spoofed replies, as shown in the terminal output. However, the right terminal shows actual ping responses from `8.8.8.8`, including the time taken for the round trip. Since `8.8.8.8` is outside the local network, ARP does not play a role here; instead, routing takes place, and the spoofed responses from the script do not interfere with the actual responses coming from the Google server.
  ![scapy](/Lab8/exercise1/img/13.png)

In conclusion, the observations from the tasks demonstrate that while spoofing can manipulate responses within a local network segment, it is limited by ARP protocol behavior and routing mechanisms outside the local network. Spoofing can create the illusion of a host's presence on a local network by replying to ARP requests and ICMP pings but cannot influence traffic once it leaves the local network for an external destination, such as the internet.
